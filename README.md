# -Male-Female-Identification-using-OpenCV
This project aims to identify gender (male/female) from facial images using OpenCV and deep learning techniques. The system detects faces in images or real-time video and classifies gender using a pre-trained model. It showcases the power of computer vision in applications such as security, marketing, and human-computer interaction.
